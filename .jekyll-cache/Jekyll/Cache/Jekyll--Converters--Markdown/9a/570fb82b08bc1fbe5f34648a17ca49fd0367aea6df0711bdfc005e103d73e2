I"î<p>Back at the end of April, 2020 I had set out to write the first draft of my book the Unintentional Calamity. Through the year I had made many leaps and bounds forward from world building to character design and plot outlining. All that preparation for three months led me to attempt to write a complete first draft by the end of December, 2020 hitting around 50,000 words. As the publishing date points out, 2020 is already gone and I still giving first draft updates. In other words, the first draft still isnâ€™t done. Now that half a year has passed since any news was given for the status of this story, I would like to explain what the original plan was, what has changed within the six month time period, and where this project will go.</p>
