I"Ù<p>Anyone would be hard pressed to find someone who has not experienced a day where they were insanely focused. We all know what it feels like to be so enveloped in our thinking that we just lose track of time. Whether it is reading a book for hours on end, playing a video game and not realizing the sun has set, or working on a personal project only to glance at the clock and notice that six hours have magically passed, we all have had these special moments. This special moment has many names, but for the sake of conversation let us define this long-term focus as a State of Flow. This special state is really important to understand as it can be used as a tool rather than a random event that occurs in everyday life.</p>
