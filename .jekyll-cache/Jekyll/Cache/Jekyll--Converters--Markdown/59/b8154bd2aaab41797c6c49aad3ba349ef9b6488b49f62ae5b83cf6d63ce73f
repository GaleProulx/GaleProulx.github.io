I"’<p>Roughly two months ago I set out to take the time to really think about the world of the Unintentional Calamity and define a plot that I could follow. With two weeks to go, I have almost accomplished every task I set for myself. Next week I will be polishing off ideas for the magic system, the week after I will develop some of the artifacts to appear in the story, and then I will officially begin writing the first draft (again). Before I dive into the fantasy world that I have built up in my head for the past four years, I would like to reflect on the journey thus far as my excitement builds to finally be writing the actual story.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my first post, this whole idea was conceived after watching <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>. After I was inspired I went out to The Barn, a building on Champlain Campus, and started writing whatever came to my mind. While it was good to get the ideas out of my head onto a piece of paper, I had no idea where the story was going. Four years ago I was a less experienced writer, but I do not think that lack of experience was necessarily a weakness. I have always believed that inexperienced professionals have just as much to offer as veterans of the field. The juxtaposed nature of creativity and learning have always been apparent in my mind, and while I feel I have grown as a writer I do believe that my imagination has narrowed. My education not only showed me what is possible, but also what is not possible. Although I have no scientific evidence to back this gut feeling, I have always suspected that childrenâ€™s imaginations are much grander than an adults because of the lack of experience in general. The more an adult learns, the less possibilities they believe in.</p>

<p>Over the past week I have spent a lot of time looking at TED Talks, reading articles, and taking time to just think about my career. Since my second year of college, I have railroaded myself into a very specific path of studying Data Science. Now, 40 hours of my week are dedicated to the soul purpose of learning a craft that is very technical.</p>
