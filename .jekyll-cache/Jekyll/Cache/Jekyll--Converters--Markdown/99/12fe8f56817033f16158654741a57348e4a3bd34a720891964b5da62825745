I"Ÿ<p>Roughly two months ago I set out to take the time to really think about the world of the Unintentional Calamity and define a plot that I could follow. With two weeks to go, I have almost accomplished every task I set for myself. Next week I will be polishing off ideas for the magic system, the week after I will develop some of the artifacts to appear in the story, and then I will officially begin writing the first draft (again). Before I dive into the fantasy world that I have built up in my head for the past four years, I would like to reflect on the journey thus far as my excitement builds to finally be writing the actual story.</p>

<h1 id="the-barn">The Barn</h1>

<p>As I mentioned in my first post, this whole idea was conceived after watching <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>. After I was inspired I went out to The Barn, a building on Champlain Campus, and started writing whatever came to my mind. While it was good to get the ideas out of my head onto a piece of paper, I had no idea where the story was going. Four years ago I was a less experienced writer, but I do not think that lack of experience was necessarily a weakness. I have always believed that inexperienced professionals have just as much to offer as veterans of the field. The juxtaposed nature of creativity and learning have always been apparent in my mind, and while I feel I have grown as a writer I do believe that my imagination has narrowed. My education not only showed me what is possible, but also what is not possible. Although I have no scientific evidence to back this gut feeling, I have always suspected that childrenâ€™s imaginations are much grander than an adults because of the lack of experience in general. The more an adult learns, the less possibilities they believe in.</p>

<p>Regardless of how I have changed as a person since I started this project, I still cherish those first moments I still remember of letting my mind go wild as I painted a blank canvas with wild ideas. For me personally, Champlain College will always be the place I associate with this project.</p>

<h1 id="my-mentors">My Mentors</h1>

<p>Over my time at Champlain College I did have some people who helped me out. Erik Shonstrom played a significant role in encouraging my writing, as he was the advisor for Chivomengro in which I contributed to, as well as my teacher for <em>Bodies: Dance</em>. My second year I convinced him to read the first half of my very first draft of this book, and he encouraged me to continue writing. In my senior year Shonstrom also met with me to just discuss the book further and was there for me when I needed someone to bounce ideas off of. Despite his laid back and intentionally lazy appearance, Shonstrom is by far on one of the smartest people I know. He taught me not only what good writing is, but also about what the future of education should look like.</p>

<p>One person who had a significant impact on my writing goes by Robsmy on an online writing community called Critique Circle. While I have never meet this person, Robsmy was gracious enough to give a very detailed critique of the first couple of chapter of my second draft. To this day, he is the only person who has given me as much honest and harsh feedback far exceeding any detailed evaluation a professor has given me. While this was literally just one small exchange on the internet, it gave me a huge boost in confidence I needed to continue with this story.</p>
