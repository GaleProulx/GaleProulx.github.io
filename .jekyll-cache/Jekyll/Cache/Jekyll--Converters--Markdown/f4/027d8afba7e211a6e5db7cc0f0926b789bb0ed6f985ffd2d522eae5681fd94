I"ç<p>When I first dove into this project I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. I had a general outline of who I wanted to work with and how we would collaborate, but I didn‚Äôt have a clear sense of what the final product would be. As we have had time to do research and develop our idea, we are starting to hone in on one idea in particular: an anthology. Making a collection of stories through calls for submissions, interviews, and data may give the impact that can help address the rough outline of Chapter 1 in the capstone document. Having this anthology readily available to the public, and more importantly students and staff, might help not only give the researchers gain a more holistic understanding of the impact of sexual violence at Champlain College, but it can help readers as well. At this point, it might be good to amend Chapter 1‚Äôs purpose statement to include educating the general public.</p>
