I"m<p>Over the past two weeks this capstone has developed new pathways to expressing information about the Clery Act data that were originally not planned. The main form of these pathways were changes to the initial data exploration visualizations to convey more meaning and a new statistic to explain how confident the researchers are that a college is reporting the correct numbers. While these new ideas sprung to life in a capstone check-in meeting, other parts of this project have been temporarily delayed. Chapters 3 and 4 will make more progress in the coming weeks now that a large part of the project changed.</p>
