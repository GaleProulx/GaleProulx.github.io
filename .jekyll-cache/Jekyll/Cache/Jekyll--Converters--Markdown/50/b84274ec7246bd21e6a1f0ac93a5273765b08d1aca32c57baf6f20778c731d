I"h<p>Roughly two months ago I set out to take the time and really think about the world of the Unintentional Calamity and define a plot that I could follow. With two weeks to go, I have almost accomplished every task I set for myself. Next week I will be polishing off ideas for the magic system. The week after, I will develop some of the artifacts to appear in the main plot of the story. After that I will officially begin writing the first draft (again). Before I take this deep dive into the fantasy world that I have built in my head for the past four years, I would like to reflect on the journey thus far.</p>
