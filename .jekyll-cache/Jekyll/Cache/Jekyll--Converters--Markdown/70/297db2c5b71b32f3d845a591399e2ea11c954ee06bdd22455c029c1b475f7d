I"‰<p>As mentioned in my previous post, the nature of my capstone is very different to other capstones in my division. Since the very nature of this capstone pertains around sexual violence, and the process will be fluid, much of my research will focus on sexual violence and not to the data analysis process. At this point I have sources ranging from academic reports to documentaries. Iâ€™ve captured both primary sources as well as secondary sources. My research is also spanning the recent history of how sexual violence has been handled in the United States and internationally. Recently I watched an informative documentary called <em>The Hunting Ground</em>. Not only did a get a fantastic view of how other colleges are handling sexual violence cases on campus, but I also got a perspective of numerous students around the country and what students are doing to change the current culture in the United States. I also learned about how to report a Title IX violation at a college to launch an investigation. Sources in this documentary conveniently listed with facts, which makes it very easy to find trails of research that I can investigate further.</p>
