I"q<p>As another week passes by the world continues to change in significant ways that unfortunately impact this capstone. With Champlain Collegeâ€™s announcement that students will not return to campus, in addition to stricter stay-at-home orders for Vermont, the part of this capstone that hoped to communicate with Champlain College has extinguished. It is no longer a viable option to talk with staff in a timely manner while finishing visualizations and writing. As of this moment, the final form of this capstone will be visualizations of the Clery Act data, inaccuracy scores, and a multiple linear regression model.</p>
