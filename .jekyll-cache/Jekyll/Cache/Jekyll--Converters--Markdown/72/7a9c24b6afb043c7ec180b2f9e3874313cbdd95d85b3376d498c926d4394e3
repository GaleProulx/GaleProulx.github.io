I"7<p>With only four weeks until the end of the semester, we are reaching the final leg of preparation for this capstone project. Before that leg ends, we still have a lot of work to do. One constant main concern for this project is getting our research approved by Champlain College’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). The paperwork we must fill out is quite extensive and will force our group to accelerate the Professional Writing side of this capstone that does not start until next semester. With the discordance in time frames, it is becoming increasingly harder to get the required work of our first semester work done while adding more work of the upcoming semester. Our hope it that both me and my partner’s schedules will line up within the next week so we can have a solid chunk of time to decide on the future of this capstone’s parameters surrounding interviews and call for submissions. Since the IRB is not required to approve projects in a specific time frame, this approval process could be a big burden if we do not get it approved before next semester.</p>
