I"<p>Creativity for a data scientist means something much different than any given artistic field. For the field of Data Science, creativity sprouts from collaboration and unique solutions to a given problem. While solution to a machine learning problem could be a beautiful orchestration of math and business mindset combined to present a beautiful, informative visualization, there are limits. A writers world is much more relaxed on creative guidelines, which is what I find I struggle with when trying to write a creative piece.</p>
