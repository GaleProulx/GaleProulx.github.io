I"õ<p>Before Thanksgiving break, I had the opportunity to present my initial prototype. Since this capstone project is different from a stereotypical Computer Science project, there was no program that showcased my process. My initial prototype reflected the Data Science process, and much less a reflection of a typical programming project. Unfortunately, I did not have any work that easily showcased all my efforts, so I had to make a presentation of all the different tasks I have set out to do.</p>
