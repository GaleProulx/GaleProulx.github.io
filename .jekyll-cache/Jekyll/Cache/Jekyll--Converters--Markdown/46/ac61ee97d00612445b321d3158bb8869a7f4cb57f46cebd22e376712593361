I"ô<p>The shortfalls of the American education system has always been a huge source of frustration throughout my life. Ever since elementary school, I can remember having to deal with teachers who were under prepared or uncaring of the work they were doing. Considering the massive impact teachers have on the future of the nation, it has always bewildered me how much America is not invested in its education system. Additionally, it amazes me how much the education system itself is unwilling to change ancient ideologyâ€™s systemic issues that exist within its own the infrastructure. These seemingly harmless flaws in the American education system are collectively harming students, discouraging professionals from becoming teachers, and continue to support a system of oppression while benefiting the wealthy. Sooner or later, this system needs to change. In order to do this, I would like to explore what these systemic issues are, how it affects everyone, and how we might be able to solve these issues.</p>
