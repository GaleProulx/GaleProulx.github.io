I"Û<p>Within the past month a lot has happened both in the world and in this capstone. No research is in complete isolation of the environment around it, thus the recent events around the world have also had a significant impact on how the rest of this capstone will progress. While I find that I did not make as much progress as I previously hoped to accomplish, considering the current circumstances of the COVID-19 outbreak I would consider my current work satisfactory.</p>
