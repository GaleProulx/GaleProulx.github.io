I"<p>Right from the start of this project four years ago, one of my main goals as a writer was to subvert expectations and create an inexplicably unfair situation for a character that had no choice but to do what was right or give up. I wanted a child to be faced with a very really situation, and explore what they might produce. In order to make this happen, a rather extreme plot had to be introduced. Over the years of developing this idea, I have realized just how hard it is to reach this goal in a believable way.</p>
