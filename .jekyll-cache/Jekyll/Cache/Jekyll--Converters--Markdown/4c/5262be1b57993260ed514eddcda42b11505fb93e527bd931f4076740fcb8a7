I"†<p>Roughly two months ago I set out to take the time to really think about the world of the Unintentional Calamity and define a plot that I could follow. With two weeks to go, I have almost accomplished every task I set for myself. Next week I will be polishing off ideas for the magic system, the week after I will develop some of the artifacts to appear in the story, and then I will officially begin writing the first draft (again). Before I dive into the fantasy world that I have built up in my head for the past four years, I would like to reflect on the journey thus far as my excitement builds to finally be writing the actual story.</p>
