For senior year capstone, I will be teaming up with Professional Writer Rose Marshall to research Sexual Violence on college campuses, specifically looking at Champlain College. For this capstone project, we will be using both data (analyzed by myself) as well a human stories (gathered by Rose), to give a more holistic understanding of the current situation on Champlain College's campus.

Although we both have a general idea of the goal for this project, the execution is not as well defined. I have gathered 10 years of data from Campus Safety & Security's website, but I do not yet know what I am going to do with the data. Further data exploration should help me find some type of in depth analysis I can perform assuming this data set alone is adequate. By design, this analysis is not just dependent on my exploration. I will also be waiting for Rose's progress to be able to provide the information she needs to back up claims. Additionally, her gathered stories might also provide insights into where I should be exploring.

Before we can get into the specific analysis, there is a significant amount of research that must be done to understand the topic we want to study. Sexual violence is a very complex issue that is constantly being advocated for by activists. Even the world of academia is constantly critiquing and hypothesizing new ways to shed light on societal conceptions and judicial issues. A lot of progress appears to have been made in this field as reported sexual violence rates have only gone down in the past thirty years. Unfortunately, it is hard to gauge the current state of sexual violence as we are reliant on reported cases.

To circumvent the issue of relying on self-reported data, this project will reach out to those affected by sexual violence in an unusual, low-stakes research project that will hopefully encourage people to speak. Also, this project will talk to individuals normally not included in research surrounding sexual violence in an attempt to capture more perspectives of the effects of sexual violence on smaller college campus communities such as Champlain College.
