Before Thanksgiving break I had the opportunity to present my initial prototype. Since this capstone project is different from a stereotypical Computer Science project, there was no program that showcased my process. My initial prototype was a reflection of the Data Science process, and much less a reflection of a typical programming project. Unfortunately, I did not have any work that easily showcased all my efforts, so I had to make a presentation of all the different tasks I have set out to do.

The first step was to gather data from the Clery Act. Downloading all the data from the Campus Safety and Security website was not hard, but merging all approxomately 200 files into one file has been a challenge. Additionally, formatting this data is proving to be hard. My presentation reflected my efforts of the challenges I was facing and the next steps I will be taking to format this data. (Turns out Excel still cannot handle 500MB of this particular dataset.)

The second step is to validate and clean the data. My current progress in this regard has been slow as I haven't had the chance to view the dataset in one place. Additionally, I will have to make some decisions as to how I interpret missing data. By law, postsecondary institutions receiving federal aid must report these numbers, so naturally the large amount of missing data is alarming.

The final step requires some type of analysis. Unsure of how I want to proceed, I have been trying to brainstorm from multiple different perspectives. From a statistics background, I could make a multiple linear regression model over a time series.
