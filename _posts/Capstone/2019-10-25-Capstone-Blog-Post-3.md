When I first dove into this project I wasn't sure what to expect. I had a general outline of who I wanted to work with and how we would collaborate, but I didn't have a clear sense of what the final product would be. As we have had time to do research and develop our idea, we are starting to hone in on one idea in particular: an anthology. Making a collection of stories through calls for submissions, interviews, and data may give the impact that can help address the rough outline of Chapter 1 in the capstone document. Having this anthology readily available to the public, and more importantly students and staff, might help not only give the researchers gain a more holistic understanding of the impact of sexual violence at Champlain College, but it can help readers as well. At this point, it might be good to amend Chapter 1's purpose statement to include educating the general public. 

One of the challenges in preventing campus sexual violence is dispelling rape myths and reinforcing bystander intervention mindsets. While orientation is a great time to educate all students attending college, it should not be the only time students have the opportunity to become educated. Champlain College may benefit from having this anthology readily available on campus. (Maybe this could stay on display in the Miller Information Commons.) Students who want to do further research could have a huge jumpstart from our capstone project. Additionally, we have already decided to work with Champlain College to help fill some of the cracks in our Title IX reporting system which will undoubtably involve looking at the college's bystander intervention program. Education should be part of the purpose statement.

Providing the context for this project was harder to do before we had any significant amount of research
