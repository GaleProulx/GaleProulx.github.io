Over the past two weeks this capstone has developed new pathways to expressing information about the Clery Act data that were originally not planned. The main form of these pathways were changes to the initial data exploration visualizations to convey more meaning and a new statistic to explain how confident the researchers are that a college is reporting the correct numbers. While these new ideas sprung to life in a capstone check-in meeting, other parts of this project have been temporarily delayed. Chapters 3 and 4 will make more progress in the coming weeks now that a large part of the project changed.

After presenting some mock exploration visualizations in demo one, it became apparent that the dataset was too complex for the initial graphs. Part of this complexity comes from the data preprocessing which narrows down the dataset to allow simplier visualizations. There are a lot of caveats that make it hard to express the correct interpretation of the data. One glaring issue with the initial graphs was the lack of communication on how many institutions were included in each year of each graph. It is hard to tell whether or not a trend is caused by a drop in institutions or a drop in reporting. To correct this confusion, I have added the number of institutions reporting in that year to show how that trend may impact the number of reports in a year. While this is a first iteration to fix confusion in interpretation, it will take more iterations to help a general audience inherently see the uncertainty in this graph.

The unexpected part of this capstone came from
